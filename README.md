# Mozzila Splash Page [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) Practice Site .

## A functional HTML, CSS splash page that was a [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Mozilla_splash_page) project. 

This splash page was an example of a MDN project that needed the ability to edit media to be able to fit and fill the screen as the resolution and size change. This splash page has the following methods used:

- Using the link in the Head to a CSS style sheet.
- The use of an HTML document and a CSS stylesheet with edited media folder
- Basic CSS styling 
- A functional iframe to a a YouTube video 
- Functional srcset to adjust image sizing when page size is shrunk
- Functional href attributes that links an image to https://www.mozilla.org/ webpage
